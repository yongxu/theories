"""Check the periphery module on slowing down before a condition's own end.

`SlowingDown` imports Mathlib's variance, covariance, independence, derivatives and limits, and no
core module, so it is compiled with Lean 4.30.0-rc2 against the installed Mathlib (`SYSTEMS_MATHLIB_PROJECT`, default
`~/repos/生生不息`). Module resolution, declaration scanning and passed-receipt
matching are those of the core checker. Every other module in the closure must
match a passed receipt. The module's own declarations may depend on Lean's three standard
axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), through Mathlib; the receipt reports
each declaration's axioms, and any other axiom (`sorryAx` among them) fails the run.
The core does not import this module. Lean steps are reused as in the core checker,
keyed also by the Mathlib revision, and run concurrently (`BECOMING_JOBS`);
`BECOMING_FRESH=1` runs every step. As in the core checker, the run folder keeps the
receipt, the drivers and logs of the steps that ran, and a copy of each file `main` does
not hold byte for byte.
